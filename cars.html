			<h1> <b> <q>Info about Sport cars</q></b> </h1>
			<p> A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble handling.The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928.Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.

Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are requisite.Sports cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of gravity compared to standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise control at high speeds.Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coup√©s also started to become popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is not absolute.</p>
